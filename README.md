# Crypto-Portfolio

This is a simple cryptocurrency portfolio tracking application built using C# and Windows Forms. The application allows users to add and manage buy/sell transactions and compare them with live market prices. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store transaction data and performs operations using CRUD functionality.

Live prices are fetched asynchronously from the CoinLore API, and portfolio performance is displayed with charts and summaries. The project also uses LINQ for querying and processing data within the application.
